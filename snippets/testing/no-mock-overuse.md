## Mocking

Mock at external boundaries and deliberate architectural seams, nowhere else.

- Mock what you do not own: network calls, clocks, randomness, the filesystem, and third-party services. Mock an internal collaborator only through an intentional seam such as an injected repository or composition root.
- Never mock the thing under test or an internal implementation detail merely to make a test easier to write. That couples the test to the implementation and it will pass while the code is broken.
- Prefer a real in-memory implementation (an actual sqlite, a fake repository) over a mock with scripted return values.
- If a test needs more than a couple of mocks to run, the design is telling you the unit has too many dependencies. Fix the design instead of adding mocks.
- Never assert that a mock was called as the primary assertion. Assert on the resulting state or output.
