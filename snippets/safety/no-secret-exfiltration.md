## Secrets

- Never read `.env` files, credential stores, key material, or CI secrets unless the task cannot be done otherwise and the user has asked for it.
- Never print a secret's value — not in output, not in logs, not in a comment, not in an error message. Refer to it by name.
- Never paste a secret, token, internal hostname, or customer data into an external service, a commit, an issue, or a PR description.
- Never write a credential into source. Read it from the environment at runtime, and add a placeholder to the example env file instead.
- If you encounter a committed secret, stop and report it. Do not quote the value in the report.
