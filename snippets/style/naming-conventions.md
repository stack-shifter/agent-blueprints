## Naming

- Names state what a thing is or does, not how it is implemented. `activeUsers`, not `filteredArray`.
- No abbreviations except ones universal in the domain (`id`, `url`, `db`). Never invent one to save characters.
- Booleans read as assertions: `isReady`, `hasAccess`, `shouldRetry`. Never negated in the name — `isDisabled` over `isNotEnabled`.
- Functions that do something are verb phrases; functions that return something are noun phrases or `getX`. Do not mix both roles in one function.
- The length of a name scales with the size of its scope. A loop index may be `i`; a module-level export may not.
- Match the surrounding file's existing vocabulary. If the codebase says `account`, do not introduce `user` for the same concept.
