## Vertical code layout

Write code that reads top to bottom like prose. Density is not concision.

- One statement per line. Never chain unrelated operations onto one line to save space.
- Separate logical stanzas with a single blank line. Group a variable's declaration with the lines that first use it.
- Declare variables close to first use, not in a block at the top of the function.
- Put the early returns and guard clauses first, then the main path. Never wrap the main path in an `else`.
- Order functions so a caller appears above the functions it calls, so the file reads at descending levels of detail.
- Break a long expression across lines at the operators, aligning the operands — do not let it wrap arbitrarily at the margin.
- Keep functions short enough to see whole. If you cannot see the top and bottom at once, extract a named helper.
