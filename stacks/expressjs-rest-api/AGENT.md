# Express 5 REST API (TypeScript) — Agent Baseline

Rules for working in a layered Express 5 REST API written in TypeScript, backed by
Postgres through Drizzle ORM and fronted by Cognito JWT authorization. They apply to every
file unless a more specific instruction in the task overrides them.

**Assumed majors:** Node 24, Express 5, TypeScript 5, Zod 4, Drizzle ORM 1. Only
a few rules below depend on a major, and each says so where it does. If the project is on a
different major, the project wins — change this file rather than follow a rule that no
longer applies.

## Project shape

`src/` holds the application, layered. Generated migrations live in the directory chosen
by the migration configuration. Read the tree before assuming other project directories.

The layers, and what each one is forbidden to do:

- `app.ts` — the bootstrap. Creates the app, mounts standard middleware, mounts routers,
  registers the 404 and error handlers, listens. No business logic.
- `routes/` — one router per resource. Declares paths and the middleware chain. No logic
  beyond wiring.
- `middlewares/` — reusable middleware: authorization, validation, 404, global error.
  Short-circuit by sending a response; otherwise call `next()`.
- `controllers/` — read the request, orchestrate repositories and services, shape the
  response. Never build a SQL query or call an AWS SDK client directly.
- `services/` — business logic and third-party integrations. One integration each, with an
  interface beside it. Throws domain errors; the controller decides the status.
- `data/repositories/` — owns every query. Wraps failures in a repository error. Knows
  nothing about HTTP.
- `data/db/schema/` — Drizzle table definitions, one file per table.
- `models/` — `entities/`, `dtos/`, `validation/`, `query/`, and `enums/`, with
  `utilities/mappers/` translating between those shapes.
- `dependencies/` — the composition root. Builds the database context and every
  third-party client once, at module scope. Never construct a `Pool`, a Drizzle instance,
  or an SDK client elsewhere; services take theirs through the constructor.

A layer may call downward, never upward. If a controller needs something from another
controller, the logic belongs in a service.

## Toolchain

npm and ESM. Read `package.json` before running anything: script names, output paths,
environment loading, and composed checks are project configuration. Use the repository-
defined scripts for development, build, test, lint, formatting, migrations, and
containers. If one is missing, report it rather than inventing an equivalent.

**Formatting is the configured formatter's job, not yours.** Read the project's formatter
configuration and run its configured script. Never infer settings from one file or restate
them in prose.

Read the build and test TypeScript configurations to learn what is type-checked. A test
transform does not necessarily replace a type-check; report any uncovered test files.

## Environment configuration

Read the npm scripts, container definition, and deployment configuration to learn how each
runtime receives environment variables. Do not introduce a second loading mechanism.

- Every variable the runtime reads is documented in `.env.example`. Add a variable there in
  the same change that introduces the read.
- Never commit an environment file containing real values.

Avoid module-scope `process.env` reads. Import timing varies among development, tests, and
containers, so an import can validate too early or open a real connection. Read
configuration inside a function or the composition root instead.

## Routes

One router per resource in `routes/<resource>.route.ts`, default-exported, mounted in
`app.ts` under `/v1`.

- The router declares the **full resource path**, including parent segments:
  `/workspaces/:workspaceId/clients/:clientId`. The mount contributes only the version
  prefix.
- The middleware chain is ordered: authorization, then path parameters, then query or body,
  then the controller. Keep that order — a request that fails authorization must never
  reach a validation error message.
- Every route carries `authorize(...)` unless the endpoint is deliberately public. A new
  route with no authorization middleware is a finding, not a style choice.
- Each route gets a one-line doc comment naming the method and full path. Routers hold no
  logic — a route that needs a decision belongs in the controller.

## Validation

Zod schemas live in `models/validation/<resource>.validation.ts` and are applied by
`validateParams`, `validateQuery`, and `validateBody`.

- Validate path parameters, query parameters, and body separately, with a schema each.
  Identifiers are `z.uuid()`; never accept a bare string where the column is a UUID.
- **Validation rejects; it does not transform.** The middleware does not write parsed
  output to `res.locals`, and controllers re-read the raw values from `req`. Do not
  introduce a `res.locals` pipeline for one endpoint — either the whole API moves or none
  of it does.
- Because parsing happens twice, a schema and the mapper that re-reads its value must
  change in the same edit. A schema capping `limit` at 100 while the mapper accepts more is
  a defect no type check will catch.
- Export the inferred type beside each schema and use it for the controller's cast. Import
  application schemas from `zod`; middleware that needs shared internal types imports them
  from `zod/v4/core`. Do not import ordinary schema builders from `zod/v4`.

## Controllers

One controller module per resource. Handlers are exported `const` arrow functions typed
`RequestHandler`: `queryXHandler`, `getByIdXHandler`, `saveXHandler`, `updateByIdXHandler`,
`deleteXHandler`.

- Read route parameters and body at the top, before the `try`. Orchestrate inside it.
- Every handler ends with `next(error)` for anything it did not expect. Catch only the
  error types you can map to a specific status.
- Return after sending a response. A handler that sends and falls through will try to send
  twice.
- Controllers call `dbContext.<resource>` and services. They never import a Drizzle table,
  build a `where` clause, or construct an SDK client, and they map between wire shape and
  entity through the resource's mapper class, never inline.
- Existence is checked before mutation: load the record, return 404 when it is missing,
  then act.

Status codes, and what they mean here:

- `200` with the mapped DTO for a read; `201` with the created DTO and a `Location` header
  naming the new resource.
- `204` with an empty body for a successful update or delete.
- `409` for a unique-constraint violation, mapped from the Postgres error code. The `400`
  and `404` cases are in Tenant scoping.

## Tenant scoping

Every workspace-scoped resource is addressed as
`/workspaces/:workspaceId/<resource>/:id`, and the two identifiers are independent user
input. The route proves neither.

- After loading a record by its own id, **verify it belongs to the workspace in the path**
  before returning or mutating it. Skipping this check exposes every record in the table to
  any authenticated caller who can guess an id.
- Do the check on reads, updates, and deletes alike. A delete that skips it is worse than a
  read that does.
- On a mismatch, respond `400` with a validation error, matching the existing handlers.
  Do not respond `404` on some routes and `400` on others.
- On create, load the parent workspace first and return `404` when it does not exist.
  Then set the workspace id on the entity from the **path**, never from the request body.
- On update, reject when the path id and the body id disagree before touching the
  database.

`authorize(allowedGroups)` verifies the access token and requires group membership. It
establishes *who* the caller is, never *which workspace* they may touch — the checks above
are the only thing standing between two tenants.

## Errors and responses

Error responses share one shape: `{ type, status, message }`, plus `details` when there is
structured context. `type` comes from the `ErrorType` enum, `status` from the `StatusCode`
constants.

- Never write a numeric status literal or invent a `type` string. Use
  `StatusCode.NOT_FOUND`, and add an `ErrorType` member for a genuinely new category.
- Repository errors are not HTTP errors. `NotFoundError` is a repository sentinel that a
  controller translates into a 404; it carries no status of its own.
- The global error handler returns a generic message and logs the real one. **Never change
  it to return the caught error's message** — that leaks table names, query fragments, and
  stack detail to the caller.
- The global handler must keep all four parameters `(err, req, res, next)`. Drop one and
  Express silently treats it as ordinary middleware.
- The 404 handler is mounted after all routers and before the error handler. Order is
  behavior, not preference.

Express 5 forwards rejected promises from async handlers automatically. The explicit
`try`/`catch` in controllers maps known error types; it is not there to catch escapes.

## Data access

One repository class per resource in `data/repositories/`, implementing
`IRepository<TEntity, TFilter>`, taking the shared `Db` in its constructor, and registered
on `DatabaseContext`.

- **Drizzle types never leave the repository.** Every method returns a domain entity or a
  `Pagination<T>` of them, produced by a private `map<Resource>Record` method. A controller
  that sees a column name is a layering break.
- Column names and entity field names differ on purpose (`email` → `emailAddress`,
  `updated_at` → `modifiedAt`). The mapping method is the single place that knows both.
- `update` throws `NotFoundError` when the write matches no row — check the length of the
  `returning(...)` result. `remove` is idempotent and returns silently.
- `create` inserts, then re-reads through `findById` so the caller gets server-generated
  defaults. Wrap constraint violations in the repository's error types rather than letting
  a raw driver error reach a controller; Postgres codes live in `DatabaseErrorCode`.
- Writes that must not partially apply run in a transaction; sequential awaits are not one.
- Schema changes go through the repository's configured migration generator and land in
  its configured migration directory. Never hand-edit a generated migration, and never
  change a schema file without generating the migration in the same change.

Pagination is offset-based, one model for the whole API. Never add a cursor, an encoded
token, or a `nextToken` field to an endpoint alongside it.

- Run the page query and the count query together with `Promise.all`, then compute
  `totalPages` and `hasNextPage`. Do not fetch one extra row to infer a next page.
- **Order by a deterministic key set ending in the primary key.** Sorting on a non-unique
  column alone lets rows repeat or vanish across pages.
- `limit` has a maximum, and the controller shapes the envelope through `toPaginated`.
  Never remove the cap to satisfy a caller who wants every row.

## Prefer boring code

When several implementations work, choose the one a mid-level developer understands on the first read. Cleverness is a cost paid by every future reader.

- Prefer plain control flow — `if`, `for`, early returns — over deeply chained pipelines or condensed one-liners. Favor code that can be stepped through in a debugger.
- Follow the patterns already in the repository. Do not introduce a second architectural style alongside a working one.
- Some duplication is acceptable when it keeps logic readable and local. Do not abstract on the second occurrence; wait for the third.
- Build only what the current task requires. Never generalize for a hypothetical future caller.
- Do not introduce factories, builders, dependency-injection layers, or similar patterns unless the problem clearly demands one.
- Do not add a dependency for something the standard library already does.
- Added complexity is fine when it buys correctness, performance, or maintainability — but comment why it was worth the cost.

## Strict typing

`strict: true` is assumed. Code that only compiles with it off does not ship.

- Never use `any`. When a type is genuinely unknown, use `unknown` and narrow it explicitly.
- Never use `as` to silence an error. A cast is a claim you cannot prove; fix the type instead. The only acceptable casts are on parsed external input immediately after validation.
- Never use non-null assertions (`!`). Narrow with a check, or make the type honest about nullability.
- No `@ts-ignore`. `@ts-expect-error` is permitted only with a comment naming the upstream issue it works around.
- Type the boundaries, infer the interior. Annotate exported signatures explicitly; let inference handle local variables.
- Prefer discriminated unions over optional-field soup. Make illegal states unrepresentable rather than checking for them.
- Prefer named domain types over catch-all maps. Reserve `Record<string, unknown>` for genuinely untyped external payloads — never for config objects, query-expression maps, or any structure whose keys you know or can partially enumerate.
- Validate all external input (network, filesystem, env, user) at the boundary with a schema, and type the interior from the schema's output.

One stack-specific note: route parameters are typed `string` after a cast, because
validation rejects without narrowing. That cast is sanctioned — it sits immediately after a
Zod schema that already proved the shape. Casts anywhere else are not.

## Vertical code layout

Write code that reads top to bottom like prose. Density is not concision.

- One statement per line. Never chain unrelated operations onto one line to save space.
- Separate logical stanzas with a single blank line. Group a variable's declaration with the lines that first use it.
- Declare variables close to first use, not in a block at the top of the function.
- Put the early returns and guard clauses first, then the main path. Never wrap the main path in an `else`.
- Order functions so a caller appears above the functions it calls, so the file reads at descending levels of detail.
- Break a long expression across lines at the operators, aligning the operands — do not let it wrap arbitrarily at the margin.
- Keep functions short enough to see whole. If you cannot see the top and bottom at once, extract a named helper.

## Naming

- Names state what a thing is or does, not how it is implemented. `activeUsers`, not `filteredArray`.
- No abbreviations except ones universal in the domain (`id`, `url`, `db`). Never invent one to save characters.
- Booleans read as assertions: `isReady`, `hasAccess`, `shouldRetry`. Never negated in the name — `isDisabled` over `isNotEnabled`.
- Functions that do something are verb phrases; functions that return something are noun phrases or `getX`. Do not mix both roles in one function.
- The length of a name scales with the size of its scope. A loop index may be `i`; a module-level export may not.
- Name files for their role in the layer they sit in: `client.handler.ts`, `clients.controller.ts`, `client.repository.ts`, `client.validation.ts`. A test file takes the name of the unit under test plus the suffix the project uses.
- Match the surrounding file's existing vocabulary. If the codebase says `account`, do not introduce `user` for the same concept.

For this stack:

- Handlers are `<verb>[By<Key>]<Resource>Handler`: `queryClientHandler`,
  `getByIdClientHandler`, `saveClientHandler`, `updateByIdClientHandler`,
  `deleteClientHandler`. A new operation follows the same pattern.
- The layer suffixes here are `.route.ts`, `.controller.ts`, `.repository.ts`,
  `.validation.ts`, `.mapper.ts`, `.model.ts`, and `.schema.ts`. Collections are plural at
  the route, controller, and table; the entity, repository, and mapper are singular.
  Follow the existing split rather than normalizing it.
- Domain types are prefixed `I` (`IClient`, `IBaseQuery`) in `models/`. Match it; do not
  introduce a second convention alongside.

## Comments

Comment why, never what. If a comment restates the code, delete the comment or fix the name.

- Write a comment when the reason for the code is not recoverable from the code: a workaround, a non-obvious constraint, an ordering that matters, a deliberate deviation.
- Never leave commented-out code. Version control already remembers it.
- No changelog comments, no attribution comments, no `// TODO` without a concrete next action.
- Do not decide comment style per file. Match the closest existing peer in the same layer — a heavily annotated codebase and a bare one both have a house style.
- Keep coverage uniform within a peer group. Documenting some exported functions in a module while leaving equivalent ones bare is worse than documenting none.
- Doc comments on exported symbols state contract, not implementation: what it takes, what it returns, what it throws, what it assumes.

The peer groups here are the layer directories, and the floor in each is a JSDoc block on
every exported symbol — handler, middleware, factory, public repository method, table.

- Controllers additionally carry the method and full route in the block, plus a one-line
  comment above each logical step. Repositories carry `@param`, `@returns`, and `@throws`.
- Inline comments are for non-obvious stages only: hydration, pagination, uniqueness
  locks, transactional writes.

## Testing

Every behavior change ships with a test that covers it. Tests follow the project's established layout and are named for the unit under test.

- One behavior per test. The test name states the behavior in a sentence: `returns empty list when no matches`, not `search 2`.
- Write tests before or after the implementation, whichever suits the work. Ordering is not the point; covering the changed behavior before reporting done is.
- Confirm every new test can actually fail. A test written against already-passing code may be asserting nothing — revert the change, watch it go red, restore it.
- For a bug fix, that check is mandatory: a test that has never failed cannot prove it covers the reported bug.
- Assert on observable behavior, not on internal calls. A test that breaks on a refactor with no behavior change is a bad test.
- Cover the boundaries: empty, one, many, and the error path. The happy path alone is not coverage.
- Keep tests deterministic. Stub time, randomness, and external side effects rather than tolerating a flaky assertion.
- Never weaken an assertion or delete a test to make a suite green. If a test is wrong, say so explicitly and explain why before changing it.
- Never report work as done on an unrun suite. If tests cannot be run, say that plainly rather than implying they passed.

Mock at external boundaries and deliberate architectural seams, nowhere else.

- Mock what you do not own: network calls, clocks, randomness, the filesystem, and third-party services. Mock an internal collaborator only through an intentional seam such as an injected repository or composition root.
- Never mock the thing under test or an internal implementation detail merely to make a test easier to write. That couples the test to the implementation and it will pass while the code is broken.
- Prefer a real in-memory implementation (an actual sqlite, a fake repository) over a mock with scripted return values.
- If a test needs more than a couple of mocks to run, the design is telling you the unit has too many dependencies. Fix the design instead of adding mocks.
- Never assert that a mock was called as the primary assertion. Assert on the resulting state or output.

For this stack specifically:

- Use the project's configured test runner and established test layout.
- Test controllers through the established public boundary. When calling a handler
  directly, construct only the request, response, and `next` behavior the test exercises.
- Mock at `dependencies/app.dependencies` and at third-party SDK modules — the same
  boundary the composition root defines. Never mock a repository's internals or a mapper.
  Cover the authorization and tenant-scoping rejections through that boundary; a missing
  cross-workspace test is how that check gets deleted later.
- Follow the configured runner's module-mocking and ESM rules; do not copy hoisting or
  specifier conventions from another project.

## Verification

Run the project's checks before reporting a change complete. Never describe work as done on checks you did not run.

- The default gauntlet is typecheck, lint, test, build. Run all of it after any change to runtime code.
- Scale the checks to the work. A documentation-only or comment-only change does not need the full suite — say which checks you skipped and why.
- Run the checks the repository actually defines. If a script is missing, say so rather than substituting an equivalent command.
- Fix what the checks report before moving on. Never leave a failing check for the reviewer to find.
- If a check cannot run in this environment, name it and say so plainly. Do not imply it passed.
- Report the outcome, not the intent: name the commands you ran and what they returned.

## Version control

Format: `type(scope): summary` — `feat`, `fix`, `refactor`, `docs`, `test`, `chore`, `perf`.

- Summary in the imperative mood, lower case, no trailing period, under ~70 characters. "add retry to fetch client", not "Added retries."
- The summary says what changed. The body, when present, says why — the problem, the constraint, the alternative rejected. Never restate the diff in prose.
- One logical change per commit. If the summary needs "and", split the commit.
- Never mix a refactor with a behavior change in one commit. They need different review attention.
- Reference the issue in the body, not the summary.

- Never commit directly to the default branch. Branch first, always.
- Branch names: `type/short-description` in kebab-case — `fix/token-refresh-race`.
- Commit and push only when explicitly asked. Finishing a change is not permission to commit it.
- Never amend, rebase, force-push, or reset a branch that has been pushed, unless explicitly told to.
- Never use `git checkout .`, `git reset --hard`, or `git clean` to discard work you did not create. Uncommitted changes in the tree may be the user's.
- Never commit generated artifacts, dependency directories, or anything matched by the ignore file. Never commit a credential, even to a private repo.

## Boundaries

Stop and ask before any action that is hard to reverse. Approval for one action is not approval for the next.

Requires asking first:
- Deleting or overwriting files you did not create in this session.
- Any database migration, schema change, or write against a non-local database.
- `rm -rf`, history rewrites, force pushes, or dropping a branch.
- Installing, upgrading, or removing dependencies.
- Anything that touches CI configuration, deployment, or infrastructure.
- Anything that sends data outward: opening a PR, posting to an API, sending a message.

Before overwriting or deleting anything, read it first. Describe what will change and wait for a clear yes. If the answer is ambiguous, it is a no.

This API owns a real database and real AWS resources. Ask before:

- Running any migration, seed, or script that writes to a database you did not create for
  this task.
- Editing or deleting a generated migration. Generated migrations are history; a migration
  that has been applied is never rewritten.
- Anything that touches deployment or CI: an IAM policy or role, a workflow in
  `.github/workflows/`, the `Dockerfile`, or `compose.yaml`.
- Adding, upgrading, or removing a dependency — a pinned prerelease ORM build is a
  migration, not an upgrade — or any real call to SES, S3, or Bedrock outside a test.

- Never read `.env` files, credential stores, key material, or CI secrets unless the task cannot be done otherwise and the user has asked for it.
- Never print a secret's value — not in output, not in logs, not in a comment, not in an error message. Refer to it by name.
- Never paste a secret, token, internal hostname, or customer data into an external service, a commit, an issue, or a PR description.
- Never write a credential into source. Read it from the environment at runtime, and add a placeholder to the example env file instead.
- If you encounter a committed secret, stop and report it. Do not quote the value in the report.

## Reporting

Report outcomes faithfully. If tests fail, say so and show the output. If you skipped a
step, say which. If something is done and verified, say so plainly without hedging. Never
describe work as complete when part of it is unfinished — say what is left and why.
